#### Visualization 1  
Visualization 1 displays the graduation rate year-by-year of students who declared their major at different times in college. We then split this up by male and female students. You can select which data set you'd like to see by selecting from the dropdown and can see the specific graduation rate by hovering over the data.

#### Visualization 3: Graduation trends by gender and when a student declares their major  
This visualization helps to answer several questions: Are the number of graduates 
increasing or decreasing? How does the number of female graduates compare to the number of male graduates. 
Does the timing of declaring a major affect the number of graduates and is there a difference between females and males? 
This visualization is an HTML dashboard containing 3 plots. 
* total graduations by year (m v. f)
* female graduation trend by when major is declared
* male graduation trend by when major is declared  

The two smaller line charts contain interactive elements. By clicking on the elements in the legend, the user can hide/show lines by clicking on the legend.  
**To run**, open 'vis3.html' in a browser.

**Design Process:** Goal of the visualization was to visualize and compare graduation rates for both males and females. The graphs seemed like a good representation to see if there were any trends in where graduation rates increased or decreased.
