#### Visualization 3: Graduation trends by gender and when a student declares their major  
This visualization helps to answer several questions: Are the number of graduates 
increasing or decreasing? How does the number of female graduates compare to the number of male graduates. 
Does the timing of declaring a major affect the number of graduates and is there a difference between females and males? 
This visualization is an HTML dashboard containing 3 plots. 
* total graduations by year (m v. f)
* female graduation trend by when major is declared
* male graduation trend by when major is declared  

The two smaller line charts contain interactive elements. By clicking on the elements in the legend, the user can hide/show lines by clicking on the legend.  
**To run**, open 'vis3.html' in a browser.
